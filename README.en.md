## Description

Graal VM best practice, use Java to develop CLI, Desktop (Java FX), Web (Spring Boot) projects, and use native-image technology to statically compile Java code into independent executable files (native images).

> Graal VM makes Java powerful again, using native-image to compile the program into an executable file of the target platform, and run directly without jvm, the startup speed is very fast, and the memory load is also very low.

## Module overview

> To experience the executable file I have compiled (Windows, Linux, Mac), [click here to download](https://gitee.com/westinyang/java-graalvm-start/releases/v1.0).
> 
> The following performance test results are tested on my native Windows. The test results are related to the machine configuration, especially the time-consuming compilation of `native-image`.

**New module**

> Brief introduction of new modules and basic test data

- [web-jlhttp](web-jlhttp)
    - Embedded HTTP Server implemented with only 3000 lines of Java code, sometimes we just want to write one or two simple interfaces for packaging and publishing. Using frameworks such as Spring is really a fuss.
    - jarfile：`52k`，Executable file size：`12.9m`， 7z：`2.9m`
- [web-nanohttpd](web-nanohttpd)
    - Another lightweight and well-designed embedded HTTP Server implementation. The library is commonly used for Android application development, but it can be used normally with Graal VM here.
    - jarfile：`54k`，Executable file size：`12.8m`， 7z：`2.9m`
- [cli-picocli](cli-picocli)
    - Picocli is a modern framework for building powerful, user-friendly, GraalVM-enabled command line apps with ease. It supports colors, autocompletion, subcommands, and more.
    - jarfile: `676k`，Executable file size：`18.2m`，7z：`4.0m`
- [web-springboot3](web-springboot3)
    - Spring Boot 3.0 has been officially released, supporting Graalvm Native Images, replacing experimental Spring Native projects.
    - jarfile: `19.2m`，Executable file size：`72.0m`，7z：`16.4m`

## Development environment

> The following is the development environment of my machine. In theory, windows, linux and mac are all supported (note that the dependencies of GraalVM SDK and native-image of different platforms are different).

- Windows 10 (CPU: i7-7700, RAM: 16G)
- IntelliJ IDEA 2020
- graalvm-ce-java11-21.3.0
- Visual Studio 2019

## Environment configuration (Windows)

**Graal VM**
- [Download Graal VM SDK](https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-builds/releases)
- Set GraalVM environment variables (note that JAVA_HOME also points to GRAALVM_HOME):
``` bat
GRAALVM_HOME = C:\path\to\graalvm-ce-java11-21.3.0
JAVA_HOME = %GRAALVM_HOME%
PATH += %GRAALVM_HOME%\bin
```
- Verify the environment `java -version`
```
C:\Users\Administrator>java -version
openjdk version "11.0.13" 2021-10-19
OpenJDK Runtime Environment GraalVM CE 21.3.0 (build 11.0.13+7-jvmci-21.3-b05)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM GraalVM CE 21.3.0 (build 11.0.13+7-jvmci-21.3-b05, mixed mode, sharing)
```
- Install native-image components
``` bat
gu install native-image
```
- Verification component
``` bat
gu list
native-image --version
```

**MSVC (Visual Studio 2019)**

> In addition to GraalVM, Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 is also required. The community version is enough, You can  [download it from here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

During the installation process, make sure to select at least the following individual components:

- Choose the English Language Pack
- C++/CLI support for v142 build tools (14.25 or later)
- MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools (v14.25 or later)
- Windows Universal CRT SDK
- Windows 10 SDK (10.0.19041.0 or later)

> All build commands, be it with Maven or Gradle, must be executed in a Visual Studio 2019 Command Prompt called x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019. A shortcut can be found in the "Start Menu", or you can search the application in the search box. Read the Microsoft documentation for more information.  
> 
> Alternatively, you can run `cmd.exe /k "<path to VS2019>\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat` from any other terminal before you can start using the build commands.

> **Recommend this ultimate solution: [Visual Studio 2019 configure MSVC environment variables, use the command line to compile](https://www.jianshu.com/p/7fab25165f4b)，In this way, MSVC compilation tools can be used directly on any terminal.**
> 
> Be sure to use this ultimate solution, otherwise it will become very troublesome in the build project. Every time before `mvn package`, you must execute `cmd.exe k "<path to VS2019>\VC\Auxiliary\ Build\vcvars64.bat`.

## Environment configuration（Linux/Mac）

**Linux**

Download Graal VM and configure environment variables. In addition to Graal VM, the following software packages are also required:

- gcc version 6 or higher
- ld version 2.26 or higher
- Ubuntu 18 also needs to install the following libraries (I have tested it in the Linux subsystem):
```shell script
sudo apt install pkg-config libgl-dev libglib2.0-dev libgtk-3-dev libpango1.0-dev libx11-dev libxtst-dev libasound2-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev
```
- Ubuntu 20 also needs to install the following libraries
```shell
sudo apt install g++-multilib
```
- For other Linux distributions, please check which dependent libraries are missing for errors when packaging, and install them yourself.

**Mac**

- xcode-select --install

For a more detailed description of different platform configurations and dependencies, please refer to:
- [install-native-image](https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/#install-native-image) `Reference when building Java applications`
- [gluon documentation](https://docs.gluonhq.com/#_platforms) `Reference when building JavaFx applications`

> tips：Gluon is a contributor to the `OpenJFX` project and the `GraalVM` project. The company provides `client-maven-plugin` to encapsulate the related commands of `native-image`, which simplifies the packaging operation.

## Precautions

- Through the above steps, you have configured the development environment. Another thing to note is that in IDEA development tools, when you need to set the JDK for the project, you should directly point to the bin directory under GraalVM, not other JDK directories, Otherwise an error may occur during compilation.

## Extended reading

- GraalVM should not support cross-compilation, but you can use the Linux subsystem provided by Windows to compile the source code.

## Follow-up planning

> For other implementations of these three applications, more modules may be added later.

- cli-&lt;A library that supports parsing args parameters> `For faster development of cli applications`
- desktop-&lt;Swing/AWT&gt; `Other GUI implementations`
- web-&lt;Lightweight, containerless http-server library> `Other web implementations`
